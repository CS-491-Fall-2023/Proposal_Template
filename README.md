# Kaavish Proposal template

Please make the following edits in `main.tex` only.
- edit information about group members in the preamble
- enter appropriate content for each section in the body

`main.tex` is to be compiled using a LaTeX compiler. It automatically includes  the other `.tex` files in this repository. There should not be any need to edit those files or to compile them separately.
